This is one of the surest ways to produce poor quality documentation. The best time to write comments is at the beginning of the process, as you write the code. Writing the comments first makes documentation part of the design process. Not only does this produce better documentation, but it also produces better designs and it makes the process of writing documentation more enjoyable.</p><h2 id="_15-1-delayed-comments-are-bad-comments" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-1-delayed-comments-are-bad-comments"><span>15.1 Delayed comments are bad comments</span></a></h2><h2 id="_15-2-write-the-comments-first" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-2-write-the-comments-first"><span>15.2 Write the comments first</span></a></h2><h2 id="_15-3-comments-are-a-design-tool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-3-comments-are-a-design-tool"><span>15.3 Comments are a design tool</span></a></h2><h2 id="_15-4-early-comments-are-fun-comments" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-4-early-comments-are-fun-comments"><span>15.4 Early comments are fun comments</span></a></h2><h2 id="_15-5-are-early-comments-expensive" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-5-are-early-comments-expensive"><span>15.5 Are early comments expensive?</span></a></h2><h2 id="_15-6-conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-6-conclusion"><span>15.6 Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>If you havenâ€™t ever tried writing the comments first, give it a try. Stick with it long enough to get used to it. Then think about how it affects the quality of your comments, the quality of your design, and your overall enjoyment of software development.
