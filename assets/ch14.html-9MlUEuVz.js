Good names are a form of documentation: they make code easier to understand. They reduce the need for other documentation and make it easier to detect errors. Conversely, poor name choices increase the complexity of code and create ambiguities and misunderstandings that can result in bugs. Name choice is an example of the principle that complexity is incremental. Choosing a mediocre name for a particular variable, as opposed to the best possible name, probably won’t have much impact on the overall complexity of a system. However, software systems have thousands of variables; choosing good names for all of these will have a significant impact on complexity and manageability.</p><h2 id="_14-1-example-bad-names-cause-bugs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_14-1-example-bad-names-cause-bugs"><span>14.1 Example: bad names cause bugs</span></a></h2><h2 id="_14-2-create-an-image" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_14-2-create-an-image"><span>14.2 Create an image</span></a></h2><h2 id="_14-3-names-should-be-precise" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_14-3-names-should-be-precise"><span>14.3 Names should be precise</span></a></h2><h2 id="_14-4-use-names-consistently" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_14-4-use-names-consistently"><span>14.4 Use names consistently</span></a></h2><h2 id="_14-6-a-different-opinion-go-style-guide" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_14-6-a-different-opinion-go-style-guide"><span>14.6 A different opinion: Go style guide</span></a></h2><h2 id="_14-7-conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_14-7-conclusion"><span>14.7 Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>Well chosen names help to make code more obvious; when someone encounters the variable for the first time, their first guess about its behavior, made without much thought, will be correct. Choosing good names is an example of the investment mindset discussed in Chapter 3: if you take a little extra time up front to select good names, it will be easier for you to work on the code in the future. In addition, you will be less likely to introduce bugs. Developing a skill for naming is also an investment. When you first decide to stop settling for mediocre names, you may find it frustrating and time-consuming to come up with good names. However, as you get more experience you’ll find that it becomes easier; eventually, you’ll get to the point where it takes almost no extra time to choose good names, so you will get the benefits almost for free.</p><p>1https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#1</p>',10)]))}const c=a(o,[["render",i]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/en/ch14.html","title":"Chapter 14 Choosing Names","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"14.1 Example: bad names cause bugs","slug":"_14-1-example-bad-names-cause-bugs","link":"#_14-1-example-bad-names-cause-bugs","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"14.2 Create an image","slug":"_14-2-create-an-image","link":"#_14-2-create-an-image","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"14.3 Names should be precise","slug":"_14-3-names-should-be-precise","link":"#_14-3-names-should-be-precise","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"14.4 Use names consistently","slug":"_14-4-use-names-consistently","link":"#_14-4-use-names-consistently","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"14.6 A different opinion: Go style guide","slug":"_14-6-a-different-opinion-go-style-guide","link":"#_14-6-a-different-opinion-go-style-guide","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"14.7 Conclusion","slug":"_14-7-conclusion","link":"#_14-7-conclusion","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1744084640000,"contributors":[{"name":"yingang","username":"yingang","email":"1246410+yingang@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/yingang"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"808ca72c9a72c5376872dd363b87914283fac24c","time":1744084640000,"email":"1246410+yingang@users.noreply.github.com","author":"Gang Yin","message":"update ci script"}]},"filePathRelative":"en/ch14.md"}');export{c as comp,h as data};
