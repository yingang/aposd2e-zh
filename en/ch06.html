The most important of these has to do with generality versus specialization. I have found over and over that specialization leads to complexity; I now think that over-specialization may be the single greatest cause of complexity in software. Conversely, code that is more general-purpose is simpler, cleaner, and easier to understand.</p><p>This principle applies at many different levels in software design. When designing modules such as classes or methods, one of the best ways to produce a deep API is to make it general-purpose (general-purpose APIs result in more information hiding). When writing detailed code, one of the most effective ways to simplify the code is by eliminating special cases, so that the common-case code handles the edge cases as well. Eliminating special cases can also make code more efficient, as we shall see in Chapter 20.</p><p>This chapter discusses the problems caused by specialization and the benefits of generality. Specialization cannot be completely eliminated, so the chapter also offers guidelines on how to separate special-purpose code from general-purpose code.</p><h2 id="_6-1-make-classes-somewhat-general-purpose" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-1-make-classes-somewhat-general-purpose"><span>6.1 Make classes somewhat general-purpose</span></a></h2><p>One of the most common decisions that you will face when designing a new class is whether to implement it in a general-purpose or special-purpose fashion. Some might argue that you should take a general-purpose approach, in which you implement a mechanism that can be used to address a broad range of problems, not just the ones that are important today. In this case, the new mechanism may find unanticipated uses in the future, thereby saving time. The general-purpose approach seems consistent with the investment mindset discussed in Chapter 3, where you spend a bit more time up front to save time later on.</p><p>On the other hand, we know that it’s hard to predict the future needs of a software system, so a general-purpose solution might include facilities that are never actually needed. Furthermore, if you implement something that is too general-purpose, it might not do a good job of solving the particular problem you have today. As a result, some might argue that it’s better to focus on today’s needs, building just what you know you need, and specializing it for the way you plan to use it today. If you take the special-purpose approach and discover additional uses later, you can always refactor it to make it general-purpose. The special-purpose approach seems consistent with an incremental approach to software development.</p><p>When I first started teaching my software design course I leaned towards the second approach (make it special-purpose to begin with), but after teaching the course a few times I changed my mind. In reviewing student projects I noticed that general-purpose classes were almost always better than special-purpose alternatives. What particularly surprised me is that general-purpose interfaces are simpler and deeper than special-purpose ones, and they result in less code in the implementation. It turns out that even if you use a class in a special-purpose way, it’s less work to build it in a general-purpose way. And, the general-purpose approach can save you even more time in the future, if you reuse the class for other purposes. But general-purpose is still better even if you don’t reuse the class.</p><p>In my experience, the sweet spot is to implement new modules in a somewhat general-purpose fashion. The phrase “somewhat general-purpose” means that the module’s functionality should reflect your current needs, but its interface should not. Instead, the interface should be general enough to support multiple uses. The interface should be easy to use for today’s needs without being tied specifically to them. The word “somewhat” is important: don’t get carried away and build something so general-purpose that it is difficult to use for your current needs.</p><h2 id="_6-2-example-storing-text-for-an-editor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-2-example-storing-text-for-an-editor"><span>6.2 Example: storing text for an editor</span></a></h2><p>Let’s consider an example from a software design class in which students were asked to build simple a GUI text editor. The editor had to display a file and allow users to point, click, and type to edit the file. It also had to support multiple simultaneous views of the same file in different windows, and it had to support multi-level undo and redo for modifications to the file.</p><p>Each of the student projects included a class that managed the underlying text of the file. The text classes typically provided methods for loading a file into memory, reading and modifying the text of the file, and writing the modified text back to a file. Many of the student teams implemented special-purpose APIs for the text class.</p><p>They knew that the class was going to be used in an interactive editor, so they thought about the features that the editor had to provide and tailored the API of the text class to those specific features. For example, if a user of the editor typed the backspace key, the editor deleted the character immediately to the left of the cursor; if the user typed the delete key, the editor deleted the character immediately to the right of the cursor.</p><p>Knowing this, some of the teams created one method in the text class to support each of these specific features:</p><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="java"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">backspace</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Cursor</span> cursor<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">delete</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Cursor</span> cursor<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>Each of these methods takes the cursor position as its argument; a special type Cursor represents this position. The editor also had to support a selection that could be copied or deleted. The students handled this by defining a Selection class and passing an object of this class to the text class during deletions:</p><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="java"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">deleteSelection</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Selection</span> selection<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>The students probably thought that it would be easier to implement the user interface if the methods of the text class corresponded to the features visible to users. In reality, however, this specialization provided little benefit for the user interface code, and it created a high cognitive load for developers working on either the user interface or the text class. The text class ended up with a large number of shallow methods, each of which was only suitable for one user interface operation. Many of the methods, such as delete, were only invoked in a single place. As a result, a developer working on the user interface had to learn about a large number of methods for the text class.</p><p>This approach created information leakage between the user interface and the text class. Abstractions related to the user interface, such as the selection or the backspace key, were reflected in the text class; this increased the cognitive load for developers working on the text class. Each new user interface operation required a new method to be defined in the text class, so a developer working on the user interface was likely to end up working on the text class as well. One of the goals in class design is to allow each class to be developed independently, but the specialized approach tied the user interface and text classes together.</p><h2 id="_6-3-a-more-general-purpose-api" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-3-a-more-general-purpose-api"><span>6.3 A more general-purpose API</span></a></h2><p>A better approach is to make the text class more generic. Its API should be defined only in terms of basic text features, without reflecting the higher-level operations that will be implemented with it. For example, only two methods are needed for modifying text:</p><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="java"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">insert</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Position</span> position<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token class-name">String</span> newText<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">delete</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Position</span> start<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token class-name">Position</span> end<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>The first method inserts an arbitrary string at an arbitrary position within the text, and the second method deletes all of the characters at positions greater than or equal to start but less than end. This API also uses a more generic type Position instead of Cursor, which reflects a specific user interface. The text class should also provide general-purpose facilities for manipulating positions within the text, such as the following:</p><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="java"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Position</span> <span class="token function">changePosition</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Position</span> position<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">int</span> numChars<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>This method returns a new position that is a given number of characters away from a given position. If the numChars argument is positive, the new position is later in the file than position; if numChars is negative, the new position is before position. The method automatically skips to the next or previous line when necessary. With these methods, the delete key can be implemented with the following code (assuming the cursor variable holds the current cursor position):</p><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="java"><pre><code><span class="line">text<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">delete</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>cursor<span class="token punctuation">,</span> text<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">changePosition</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>cursor<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>Similarly, the backspace key can be implemented as follows:</p><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="java"><pre><code><span class="line">text<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">delete</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>text<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">changePosition</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>cursor<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> cursor<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>With the general-purpose text API, the code to implement user interface functions such as delete and backspace is a bit longer than with the original approach using a specialized text API. However, the new code is more obvious than the old code. A developer working in the user interface module probably cares about which characters are deleted by the backspace key. With the new code, this is obvious. With the old code, the developer had to go to the text class and read the documentation and/or code of the backspace method to verify the behavior. Furthermore, the general-purpose approach has less code overall than the specialized approach, since it replaces a large number of special-purpose methods in the text class with a smaller number of general-purpose ones.</p><p>A text class implemented with the general-purpose interface could potentially be used for other purposes besides an interactive editor. As one example, suppose you were building an application that modified a specified file by replacing all occurrences of a particular string with another string. Methods from the specialized text class, such as backspace and delete, would have little value for this application. However, the general-purpose text class would already have most of the functionality needed for the new application. All that is missing is a method to search for the next occurrence of a given string, such as this:</p><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="java"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Position</span> <span class="token function">findNext</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Position</span> start<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token class-name">String</span> string<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>Of course, an interactive text editor is likely to have a mechanism for searching and replacing, in which case the text class would already include this method.</p><h2 id="_6-4-generality-leads-to-better-information-hiding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-4-generality-leads-to-better-information-hiding"><span>6.4 Generality leads to better information hiding</span></a></h2><p>The general-purpose approach provides a cleaner separation between the text and user interface classes, which results in better information hiding. The text class need not be aware of specifics of the user interface, such as how the backspace key is handled; these details are now encapsulated in the user interface class. New user interface features can be added without creating new supporting functions in the text class. The general-purpose interface also reduces cognitive load: a developer working on the user interface only needs to learn a few simple methods, which can be reused for a variety of purposes.</p><p>The backspace method in the original version of the text class was a false abstraction. It purported to hide information about which characters are deleted, but the user interface module really needs to know this; user interface developers are likely to read the code of the backspace method in order to confirm its precise behavior. Putting the method in the text class just makes it harder for user interface developers to get the information they need. One of the most important elements of software design is determining who needs to know what, and when. When the details are important, it is better to make them explicit and as obvious as possible, such as the revised implementation of the backspace operation. Hiding this information behind an interface just creates obscurity.</p><h2 id="_6-5-questions-to-ask-yourself" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-5-questions-to-ask-yourself"><span>6.5 Questions to ask yourself</span></a></h2><p>It is easier to recognize a clean general-purpose class design than it is to create one. Here are some questions you can ask yourself, which will help you to find the right balance between general-purpose and special-purpose for an interface.</p><p>What is the simplest interface that will cover all my current needs? If you reduce the number of methods in an API without reducing its overall capabilities, then you are probably creating more general-purpose methods. The special-purpose text API had at least three methods for deleting text: backspace, delete, and deleteSelection. The more general-purpose API had only one method for deleting text, which served all three purposes. Reducing the number of methods makes sense only as long as the API for each individual method stays simple; if you have to introduce lots of additional arguments in order to reduce the number of methods, then you may not really be simplifying things.</p><p>In how many situations will this method be used? If a method is designed for one particular use, such as the backspace method, that is a red flag that it may be too special-purpose. See if you can replace several special-purpose methods with a single general-purpose method.</p><p>Is this API easy to use for my current needs? This question can help you to determine when you have gone too far in making an API simple and general-purpose. If you have to write a lot of additional code to use a class for your current purpose, that’s a red flag that the interface doesn’t provide the right functionality. For example, one approach for the text class would be to design it around single-character operations: insert inserts a single character and delete deletes a single character. This API is both simple and general-purpose. However, it would not be particularly easy to use for a text editor: higher-level code would contain lots of loops to insert or delete ranges of characters. The single-character approach would also be inefficient for large operations. Thus it’s better for the text class to have built-in support for operations on ranges of characters.</p><h2 id="_6-6-push-specialization-upwards-and-downwards" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-6-push-specialization-upwards-and-downwards"><span>6.6 Push specialization upwards (and downwards!)</span></a></h2><p>Most software systems must inevitably have some code that is specialized. For example, applications provide specific features for their users; these are often highly specialized. Thus it isn’t usually possible to eliminate specialization altogether. However, specialized code should be cleanly separated from general-purpose code. This can be done by pushing the specialized code either up or down in the software stack.</p><p>One way to separate specialized code is to push it upwards. The top-level classes of an application, which provide specific features, will necessarily be specialized for those features. But this specialization need not percolate down into the lower-level classes that are used to implement the features. We saw this in the editor example earlier in this chapter. The original student implementation leaked specialized user-interface details such as the behavior of the backspace key down into the implementation of the text class. The improved text API pushed all of the specialization upwards into the user interface code, leaving only general-purpose code in the text class.</p><p>Sometimes the best approach is to push specialization downwards. One example of this is device drivers. An operating system typically must support hundreds or thousands of different device types of devices, such as different kinds of secondary storage devices. Each of these device types has its own specialized command set. In order to prevent specialized device characteristics from leaking into the main operating system code, operating systems define an interface with general-purpose operations that any secondary storage device must implement, such as “read a block” and “write a block”. For each different device, a device driver module implements the general-purpose interface using the specialized features of that particular device. This approach pushes specialization down into the device drivers, so that the core of the operating system can be written without any knowledge of specific device characteristics. This approach also makes it easy to add new devices: if a device has enough features to implement the device driver interface, it can be added to the system with no changes to the main operating system.</p><h2 id="_6-7-example-editor-undo-mechanism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-7-example-editor-undo-mechanism"><span>6.7 Example: editor undo mechanism</span></a></h2><p>In the GUI editor project, one of the requirements was to support multi-level undo/redo, not just for changes to the text itself, but also for changes in the selection, insertion cursor, and view. For example, if a user selects some text, deletes it, scrolls to a different place in the file, and then invokes undo, the editor must restore its state to what it was just before the deletion. This includes restoring the deleted text, selecting it again, and also making the selected text visible in the window.</p><p>Some of the student projects implemented the entire undo mechanism as part of the text class. The text class maintained a list of all the undoable changes. It automatically added entries to this list whenever the text was changed. For changes to the selection, insertion cursor, and view, the user interface code invoked additional methods in the text class, which then added entries for those changes to the undo list. When undo or redo was requested by the user, the user interface code invoked a method in the text class, which then processed the entries in the undo list. For entries related to text, it updated the internals of the text class; for entries related to other things, such as the selection, the text class called back to the user interface code to carry out the undo or redo.</p><p>This approach resulted in an awkward set of features in the text class. The core of undo/redo consists of a general-purpose mechanism for managing a list of actions that have been executed and stepping through them during undo and redo operations. The core was located in the text class along with special-purpose handlers that implemented undo and redo for specific things such as text and the selection. The special-purpose undo handlers for the selection and the cursor had nothing to do with anything else in the text class; they resulted in information leakage between the text class and the user interface, as well as extra methods in each module to pass undo information back and forth. If a new sort of undoable entity were added to the system in the future, it would require changes to the text class, including new methods specific to that entity. In addition, the general-purpose undo core had little to do with the general-purpose text facilities in the class.</p><p>These problems can be solved by extracting the general-purpose core of the undo/redo mechanism and placing it in a separate class:</p><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="java"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">History</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

Each History.Action describes a single operation, such as a text insertion or a change in the cursor location, and it provides methods that can undo or redo the operation. The History class knows nothing about the information stored in the actions or how they implement their undo and redo methods. History maintains a history list describing all of the actions executed over the lifetime of an application, and it provides undo and redo methods that walk backwards and forwards through the list in response to user-requested undos and redos, calling undo and redo methods in the History.Actions.</p><p>History.Actions are special-purpose objects: each one understands a particular kind of undoable operation. They are implemented outside the History class, in modules that understand particular kinds of undoable actions. The text class might implement UndoableInsert and UndoableDelete objects to describe text insertions and deletions. Whenever it inserts text, the text class creates a new UndoableInsert object describing the insertion and invokes History.addAction to add it to the history list. The editor’s user interface code might create UndoableSelection and UndoableCursor objects that describe changes to the selection and insertion cursor.</p><p>The History class also allows actions to be grouped so that, for example, a single undo request from the user can restore deleted text, reselect the deleted text, and reposition the insertion cursor. To implement grouping the History class uses fences, which are markers placed in the history list to separate groups of related actions. Each call to History.redo walks backwards through the history list, undoing actions until it reaches the next fence. The placement of fences is determined by higher-level code by invoking History.addFence.</p><p>This approach divides the functionality of undo into three categories, each of which is implemented in a different place:</p><ul><li>A general-purpose mechanism for managing and grouping actions and invoking undo/redo operations (implemented by the History class).</li><li>The specifics of particular actions (implemented by a variety of classes, each of which understands a small number of action types).</li><li>The policy for grouping actions (implemented by high-level user interface code to provide the right overall application behavior).</li></ul><p>Each of these categories can be implemented without any understanding of the other categories. The History class does not know what kind of actions are being undone; it could be used in a variety of applications. Each action class understands only a single kind of action, and neither the History class nor the action classes needs to be aware of the policy for grouping actions.</p><p>The key design decision was the one that separated the general-purpose part of the undo mechanism from the special-purpose parts, creating a separate class for the general-purpose part and pushing the special-purpose parts down into subclasses of History.Action. Once that was done, the rest of the design fell out naturally.</p><p>Note: the suggestion to separate general-purpose code from special-purpose code refers to code related to a particular mechanism. For example, special-purpose undo code (such as code to undo a text insertion) should be separated from general-purpose undo code (such as code to manage the history list). However, it may make sense to combine special-purpose code for one mechanism with general-purpose code for another. The text class is an example of this: it implements a general-purpose mechanism for managing text, but it includes special-purpose code related to undoing. The undo code is special-purpose because it only handles undo operations for text modifications. It doesn’t make sense to combine this code with the general-purpose undo infrastructure in the History class, but it does make sense to put it in the text class, since it is closely related to other text functions.</p><h2 id="_6-8-eliminate-special-cases-in-code" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-8-eliminate-special-cases-in-code"><span>6.8 Eliminate special cases in code</span></a></h2><p>Up until this point I have been discussing specialization in the context of class and method design. Another form of specialization occurs in the code for method bodies, in the form of special cases. Special cases can result in code that is riddled with if statements, which make the code hard to understand and are prone to bugs. Thus, special cases should be eliminated wherever possible. The best way to do this is by designing the normal case in a way that automatically handles the edge conditions without any extra code.</p><p>In the text editor project, students had to implement a mechanism for selecting text and copying or deleting the selection. Most students introduced a state variable in their selection implementation to indicate whether or not the selection exists. They probably chose this approach because there are times when no selection is visible on the screen, so it seemed natural to represent this notion in the implementation. However, this approach resulted in numerous checks to detect the “no selection” condition and handle it specially.</p><p>The selection handling code can be simplified by eliminating the “no selection” special case, so that the selection always exists. When there is no selection visible on the screen, it can be represented internally with an empty selection, whose starting and ending positions are the same. With this approach, the selection management code can be written without any checks for “no selection”. When copying the selection, if the selection is empty then 0 bytes will be inserted at the new location; if implemented correctly, there will be no need to check for 0 bytes as a special case. Similarly, it should be possible to design the code for deleting the selection so that the empty case is handled without any special-case checks. Consider a selection all on a single line. To delete the selection, extract the portion of the line preceding the selection and concatenate it with the portion of the line following the selection to form the new line. If the selection is empty, this approach will regenerate the original line.</p><p>Chapter 10 will discuss exceptions, which create many more special cases, and how to reduce the number of places where they must be handled.</p><h2 id="_6-9-conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-9-conclusion"><span>6.9 Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>Unnecessary specialization, whether in the form of special-purpose classes and methods or special cases in code, is a significant contributor to software complexity. Specialization can’t be eliminated completely, but with good design you should be able to reduce it significantly and separate specialized code from general-purpose code. This will result in deeper classes, better information hiding, and simpler and more obvious code.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div class="vp-meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><time class="meta-item-info" datetime="2025-05-14T01:24:18.000Z" data-allow-mismatch>5/14/25, 1:24 AM</time></div><!----></div></footer><nav class="vp-page-nav" aria-label="page navigation"><a class="route-link auto-link prev" href="/aposd2e-zh/en/ch05.html" aria-label=" Chapter 5 Information Hiding (and Leakage)"><!--[--><div class="hint"><span class="arrow left"></span> Prev</div><div class="link"><span class="external-link"> Chapter 5 Information Hiding (and Leakage)</span></div><!--]--></a><a class="route-link auto-link next" href="/aposd2e-zh/en/ch07.html" aria-label=" Chapter 7 Different Layer, Different Abstraction"><!--[--><div class="hint">Next <span class="arrow right"></span></div><div class="link"><span class="external-link"> Chapter 7 Different Layer, Different Abstraction</span></div><!--]--></a></nav><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
